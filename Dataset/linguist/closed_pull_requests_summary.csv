Limited testing suggest this solves the recently identified problems and the reason for the old grammar (see https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3775#issuecomment-322459597) but the only thing I'm not sure about is testing picks up a duplicate for the scope:

```

  Current package: vendor/grammars/language-javascript
  Previous package: vendor/grammars/babel-sublime

Whilst both do indeed use the `source.js` scope, `convert-grammars` only pulls in this scope for the babel-sublime grammar now.

Is this going to cause us a problem @Alhadis or @pchaigno?

This PR also does a little tidying up thanks to the `script/add-grammar` pulling other scripts which found two missing references in the `vendor/README.md` file and also an old license.

To sum things up, the associated `.sol` extension is shared by files on GitHub that don't correspond to a language, and it's impossible for a linguist heuristic to return that as a result. This is referred to as the `not-a-language` feature, which is apparently non-trivial to implement. In the meantine, we've agreed on adding the language without an extension, so that repositories can at least use `.gitattributes` overrides to get syntax highlighting.

Here's [a Github search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=pragma+solidity&type=Code) for the language with more than 25000 results.

* Conflicts with PR #3559.
* Adds [Solidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity) as a language ([search result](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Asol+%22pragma+solidity%22&type=Code)).
* Changes current vendor of `source.solidity` grammar from [davidhq/SublimeEthereum](https://github.com/davidhq/SublimeEthereum) to [caktux/language-ethereum](https://github.com/caktux/language-ethereum). The latter includes work on the former, and provides a few more grammar files. Language detection for those can be more easily integrated later on, if needed.
* Includes a simple heuristic to differentiate between Eagle soldermask `.sol` files and Solidity, and a test for that. The new Eagle samples are from [storborg/regerberate](https://github.com/storborg/regerberate), which is [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/storborg/regerberate/tree/ed85bb545109950946af90118b058abf9b0bcd3b/samples/eagle).

### Previous attempts

[Sorted chronologically](https://github.com/github/linguist/pulls?q=is%3Apr+solidity+sort%3Acreated-asc):

* PR #2634 - closed as stale, due to possible mis-classification of many non-Solidity files with `.sol` extension;
* PR #3161 - merged manually, proposed [davidhq/SublimeEthereum](https://github.com/davidhq/SublimeEthereum) as `grammar` vendor;
* PR #3522 - closed as unheeding to discussion in PR #2634;
* PR #3559 - currently open, proposes using `.gitattributes` as discussed in PR #2634 and builds directly on top of that (rather old HEAD), resulting in merge conflicts. [Includes example that's licensed under GPLv3](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3559#issuecomment-292938301), to the best of my knowledge.

### Outstanding issues

- [x] `TestGrammars` complains that the license for the [caktux/language-ethereum](https://github.com/caktux/language-ethereum) vendor needs to be ""whitelisted"". It is unclear to me whether this action must be performed by a github/linguist maintainer, or can be done by me. The [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/caktux/language-ethereum/blob/master/LICENSE.md) has a non-standard note on inclusion of prior work from [davidhq/SublimeEthereum](https://github.com/davidhq/SublimeEthereum).
- [ ] CI fails due to this (see [relevant build log](https://travis-ci.org/github/linguist/jobs/226368502#L1153)).
- [ ] `master` has drifted since PR opening - will rebase when the above is clarified.
- [x] Heuristic may still mis-classify many files (see [next comment](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3560#issuecomment-293001855), or issue #3589).
- [x] Heuristics test ~~missing~~ added.
- [x] A way of indicating `not-a-language` detection ~~is~~ was proposed, but moved to https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3589#issuecomment-298168908 due to its hackish nature."

>The AngelCode Scripting Library, or AngelScript as it is also known, is an extremely flexible cross-platform scripting library designed to allow applications to extend their functionality through external scripts. It has been designed from the beginning to be an easy to use component, both for the application programmer and the script writer.
For the script writer the scripting language follows the widely known syntax of C/C++, but without the need to worry about pointers and memory leaks. Contrary to most scripting languages, AngelScript uses the common C/C++ datatypes for more efficient communication with the host application.

The selected color is also from the same website.

It's worth noting that malformed modelines can still change a file's language in Emacs. Provided the `-*-` delimiters are intact, and the mode's name is decipherable, Emacs will set the language _and_ complain about a malformed modeline.

<img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2346707/18607443/2230b136-7d10-11e6-95ad-15f0280dc2c9.png"" width=""373"" alt=""# -*- foo-bar mode: ruby -*-"" />

I took this into consideration when rewriting the pattern, sensing that not every user knows or cares if an Emacs modeline isn't being parsed correctly (so long as the correct highlighting is shown).

My suggestion was to maintain a list of repository links in the form of a `README.md` file, which would be programmatically updated whenever grammars are added or removed. This PR is an implementation of that suggestion.

Some things that're missing:
- **We need to tie this into a build step:**  
  I'm not familiar with Bundler or Rake, so I don't know where or how to go about having this script called when `bundle exec rake` is called. Somebody help, please? =)
- **A better preamble for the readme:**  
  I only added it as a placeholder to verify that rerunning the script wouldn't chop it off each time it executed. Feel free to replace the wording with something you feel is more appropriate.

It's a full-blown Turing-complete programming language which just happens to be used primarily for graphical purposes. Wikipedia's entry on [DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) even uses PostScript to describe why the term ""Domain-specific language"" can be nebulous:

> For example, Perl was originally developed as a text-processing and glue language, for the same domain as AWK and shell scripts, but was mostly used as a general-purpose programming language later on. **By contrast, PostScript is a Turing complete language, and in principle can be used for any task, but in practice is narrowly used as a page description language.**

I don't know if there's any difference between `markup` and `programming` as far as Linguist's classifications are concerned, but I felt impelled to correct this nonetheless. [Here's an example of a program](https://github.com/bwipp/postscriptbarcode) written in PostScript that's written like, uh, a program.

Expect is essentially a Tcl extension that allows you to automate interactive scripts. It is installed by default on macOS and most Linux distributions.

I added the `.exp` extension to `languages.yml` and copied an example script from the [Expect tarball](https://sourceforge.net/projects/expect/files/Expect/5.45/expect5.45.tar.gz/download).

There appear to be [many other Expect scripts](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=extension%3Aexp+NOT+nothack&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93) in GitHub, although not all files with the `.exp` extension are in fact Expect scripts. Perhaps we could only support files with a shebang like `#!/usr/bin/expect` or `#!/usr/bin/env expect`? I don't know how to do this.

One day I hope to add a separate language solely for Expect. I filed an [Issue with Pygments](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/issues/1273/add-lexer-for-expect-programming-language#comment-None) to get started on that work.

The original author Alex Neslusan @deadfoxygrandpa is unresponsive since 2016-04-10.

There is a [syntax change](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.17.md#updating-syntax) in Elm language version 0.17 that needs to be reflected in the package's grammar rules. The existing grammar renders most of the new Elm 0.17 source code red for being illegal.

On 2016-04-06 the language creator @evancz [asked](https://github.com/deadfoxygrandpa/Elm.tmLanguage/issues/99) deadfoxygrandpa to update his package for the new syntax. Four days later deadfoxygrandpa promised to do it. Since then deadfoxygrandpa wasn't seen on GitHub or on Elm's mailing lists [elm-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elm-discuss) and [elm-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elm-dev).

## Examples

The sample files were ones I slapped together in 3DS Max earlier this afternoon. I kept them simple to avoid adding too much weight to the repository - OBJ files, like SVGs, can grow very large with too much detail.
## Relevant

I'm aware GitHub supports [3D models](https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing), even going as far as [supporting geometry diffs](https://github.com/blog/1633-3d-file-diffs). However, this support is limited to STL files, which're mostly CAD-related. I understand if GitHub don't want to go too crazy with supporting so many different 3D formats, but if there's any format that deserves support in real-time previews, it's definitely OBJ.

I don't know who to ask or where to go to propose adding support for the format on the site. But I can tell you now, there'd be many users who'd appreciate it.

##### Fix test classifier assertion

`Classifier.classify` returns array of array, with each nested array
having exactly two values.The first value is the candidate language
names, which this fix plucks and forms a flat array. Then it asserts
that the intended language name should exist in this flat array.

In this case, `classify()` was returning `[[""YAML"", ""..""], [""JSON"", ""..""]]`
even for `samples/JSON/filename/.eslintrc`, so the current assertion
was failing as it was checking for `result.first[0]`.

Lektor content files have the `.lr` extension which does not conflict with anything in linguist.  These files contain key/value pairs where most multi line values follow typically markdown syntax.

It also adds an alias for INI files for `.lektorproject`.

Here, I propose to add 3 file extensions for [Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home). All 3 of these file extensions are unique to Python.

The author of Snakemake lists the following [file extensions for Snakefiles](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/FAQ#markdown-header-how-do-i-enable-syntax-highlighting-in-vim-for-snakefiles):
- .rules
- .snakefile
- .snake

and the following filenames:
- Snakefile

Aside: In the future, when Snakemake is more mature, it may be sensible to provide a language grammar based on Python and customized for Snakemake. Currently, I favor highlighting Snakemake files like Python files.

This change has the downside of reading + line-splitting all data in all files, instead of just some files as before.

A better solution would just peek the first, say, 200 bytes from the file and look for the header there. But the FileBlob interface is extremely limited. Should I extend it?

Thanks.
